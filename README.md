## What is a recommendation system?
Recommendation systems are machine learning algorithms that use data to recommend items or content based on user specific behaviour, past preferences or a combination of both. These systems can recommend various ietms such as books, movies, music etc. For this project we will be creating a recommendation system to suggest Spotify music to users based on their behaviour.

### Types of recommendation systems

There are three main approaches to building recommendation systems, these are content based filtering, collaborative filtering and hybid recommendation systems. All three of these approaches will be explored throughout the scope of this project. 

**Content Based Filtering** : This approach focuses on analysing attributes of a product, such as brand, price, category and recommending a product that matches that users preference. 

**Collaborative Filtering** : This approach focuses on the similarity of the behaviour of users. It assumes that users who have similar behaviour or have agreed on a common product/service in the past will agree in the future. 

**Hybrid Recommendation** : This approach simply just combines the prior to approaches, hence reaping the reards of both approaches. 

Although, each of these approaches have their pros and cons and these will be explored within this project.


## Data Collection and Preprocessing
This step involves cleaning the data, removing duplicates and handling any missing data within columns.
